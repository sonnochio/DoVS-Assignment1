# Tast 1
I found out that the circle disapperared. My brain will complete the missing feature - however the cross thing didin't really work for me

# Task 2
Yeah I had no problem identifying all of them

# Task 3 
Because the M and L cone cells are tired out around the 500-600nm, hence it can still see 460nm and 700nm, which are blue and red. The shape is maintained by an "afterimage" caused from looking at flashing color.

# Task 4
Again the cones are fatigued, hence disappearing, it is filling up the motion with the color that is the rest...

all stimulus fades away after..

"This is because the tactile neurons have adapted and start to ignore the unimportant stimulus. But if one jiggles one's arm up and down, giving varying stimulation, one will continue to feel the paper."

# Task 5
You referece other length in the images, for example from 1 leg to another, blue appears to be longer. 

Also in a 3D setting, blue has to be longer. But because it's flat so it's not.

For Image 2, B is lighter than it's surroundings, hence must be lighter than A... however they are the same shade

# Task 6
This might just be our blind spots filling the black in the intersections..

The real answers is an image triggers several photoreceptors that pools the input of a decision. 

# Task 7
Again it's like the stronger contrast caused a different of photorecepteors being fired. And it's trying to fill the neighborhood. 

# Task 8 
your brain lacks refereces, so it's filling in information 

# Task 9
8

# Task 12
The code is wrong.

```
RGB = imread('peppers.png');  


HSV = rgb2hsv(RGB);
[H,S,V] = imsplit(HSV);
montage( {H,S,V}, 'Size', [1 3]) 
```

# Task 13
```

RGB = imread('peppers.png');  


XYZ = rgb2xyz(RGB);
[X,Y,Z] = imsplit(XYZ);
montage( {X,Y,Z}, 'Size', [1 3]) 

```
