This is where you should keep your logbook for this Lab. You should write down what you have done, what you have learned and your results here.

It is useful to learn and use Markdown for your logbook. Markdown is not only useful for GitHub, but also for Notion and my favourite - Obsidian, for taking notes and writing logs.
